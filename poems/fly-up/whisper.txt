Whisper - 23 April 2019

Someday I will know the secrets of your mind
Know when to whisper, our love one of a kind
Making us want to live in each other's shelter
Wonderful love to have in any kind of weather

You were the dawn breaking the bounds of night
A promise that tomorrow we'd embrace so tight
Surrounding me in a stream of lovely thoughts
Making life tenable like a curve connecting dots

Strength you gave me to fight the good fight
Sing in praise of he who endowed us with might
