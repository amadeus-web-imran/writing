All along we've been conditioned to say "child, I live for thee,"
Is why it's been OK to say a woman's life ends when she marries!
But from our deepest depths we say NO to all that is silly,
Yes, we want worthy partners and life ain't all roses n lilies.

We give birth to children of every shade and hue, often adding
Still more that we adore. Sometimes those hues turn out to be hard
To bear, for without stable moorings, they become uncouth and grueling,
And we lose self esteem, nagged by doubt, cut deep as by a shard

Of glass. Then along comes this Bard with a heart of gold
Who reminds us that the steel we're made of was tempered
In the fires of motherhood, that, as it was in days of old,
Everybody that caused us pain, will be judged and we delivered,

For a mightier law than that of Earthly man shall hold
Us in high regard, calling out the atrocities of men,
Children and society. Our hearts calmed, we're now bold,
Not timid, as we recognise the indwelling Goddess, then

Comes a long pause, after which to us is given the choice -
How do we want remedy? Do we spare the rod and spoil the child?
Or wait for realization to dawn as events in their lives gain their own voice?
Whatever betide, a mother's love is only strong, never mild.
