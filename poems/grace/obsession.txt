I guess in all my writing about the pain others go through, my intention was not to say "I know and can heal the problem", rather share your emotions with me and lets have a conversation, from which a little comforting may come.

Obsession, 19th May

No amount of wishful thinking we do can compare,
With the pain a mother feels for a child who doesn't care.
Robbed of past joys, they must face circumstances that on them does weigh,
Heavily when a child, fights constantly, and them does slay.

You see, the motherly instinct does cause them much wonder,
When children seem a blessing - a journey with much splendour.
Then the child faces hardship, a design foretold by the stars,
A pain made ever so bitter-sweet, but of the music, they remember only the bars,

A refrain of a melody from days gone by.
That come to haunt as there is no more I,
Just a raw pain for the tormented child who does
Wreak havoc on the mother, who alone knows the woes

And the hormonal shifs she knew when carrying that bundle of joy.
Now she's despondent, waiting for the day she'll no longer be a toy.
In the cosmic play - the Lila we know as the human condition,
Learning to curb the tumults of the human equation.

What good amidst eternal sorrow, O me, O life,
The pain increases and explodes with inconsiderate strife!
Have faith my dearest, its all part of the wonder we call life,
The lows, the highs, the ebbs the flows, they all cut like a knife!
