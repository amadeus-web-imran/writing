[Friend]

Look at all the trial and tribulation
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine,
They mask the pain and I'm in oblivion
Until sober next day amd dreaming of more wine and dine.

I keep the facade in front of most people
But I'm pulled to taut and often snap.
[Poet]
That's me too, my friend, though the exact
circumstances are different and I wonder

At what cruel God would have our children
Grow between warring factions and carry
The weight of the wars that rage all around
