If life is indeed a battlefield, where, as John Keating puts
It - the casualties could indeed be our hearts and souls,
Isn't it heartwarming to know Lee, that together with your guts
On the line, You and She have filled many a traveller's bowls

With what overflows from your cups. Have an unshakeable faith
That, though the times seem difficult, our collective wills will prevail.
Yes it seems like end of days, where walks a ringwraith -
A servant of the Dark Lord, but his designs WILL ultimately fail!

Part of me is glad you exited mainstream religion - it causes
Blindness, but know that in our future lies a synthesis of all
That we have known, messages of love and peace like Jesus
Said, but the powerful few only want us to fight, so don't fall

For more traps of divisiveness. Now we know the spectrum,
And slowly with right education we can prevent and reverse
The scars borne by victims of hateful propaganda. Boy are we dumb
To not have heard sooner the rallying call, the 600 years of verse

That could have brought us back sooner from the precipice
of insanity. But dont worry too much the timelines, Nature
Knows just when to give us free rein, when not to mock or diss
The foolish masses. Follow your heart and let increase your stature.
