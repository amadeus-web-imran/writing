Young man, it's years since I held your hand
As a wee baby. Do create magic as with a wand
And show us elders what it means to have magic
In our lives as we look back. And... just in the nick

Of time, more young explorers of your stature
Should make us feel like caring for Mother Nature.
Oh Nina, fill our minds again of times far out,
Regain a font of love, remind us what life is all about.

We've only one shot at living, so have us unlearn
And decondition, becoming the fountain not the cistern.
Is it only 10 years you have existed or did you walk
Among the fields in ages past? Show us how to talk

To the trees and the wind, as only an old Earth soul
Like you can teach us. Herald a new age, make us whole
And wholesome as humanity navigates dangerous
Times. Become the rallying call, as one courageous

Yet compassionate, steeped in wisdoms ancient.
Let the fires of life forge you, O' from heaven sent.
I believe that in your generation lies the key,
So, let's demystify living for all and sundry!
