Its not easy to lose a loved one to some outlandish demands
When with much grit you have clung on and provided for them.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree or so they say, but commands
Wont work with me anymore - you see, I have decided to stem

The bleeding of my life's energy into a relationship recently marred.
Long live the tree, at last I've broken the bonds... truly broken free.
But at the least memory of you, I realise how deep the wounds, how deeply scarred
I am. I look to the bard for solace, and hear him calling out to me.

[Bard]

Sweet mother now and mother figure of my youth, dont u know me?
I spent my summers under that same tree, so only know to wax philosophic.
Or so we thought until I faced my own trials, newly returned with glee,
Hoping you will let my words comfort you, especially now when you're feeling sick.

We live in the light and by sparkling pools of Mother Nature,
Who knows whats best for us, and gestures when a soul contract is over.
But the procession of memories in our minds is so strong, we simply cannot cure
Ourselves, until we let go the attachments. So at least mentally sever

Them for a while till you've regained your balance.
Put yourself first, and then lets find a worthy activity
To lend our body and mind to, and soon life will start to make sense
Again. For now let's just be strong and fight tooth and nail for our sanity.
