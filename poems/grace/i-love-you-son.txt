I love you son, you're the answer to my prayer.
I love you son, you're my most cherished treasure.
I love you son, countless are the nights we stayed up to greet
The sun in all its splendour - the sound of birds so very sweet.

I'm with you son, you do not have to face the darkness alone.
I'm with you son, though countless forces try to turn your dreams to stone.
I'm with you son, fight those forces with your hardy laugh hard won.
Think of me my dear, with a golden blanket covering you  - ah how your face shone.

With me in heart, you gave me a reason to go on.
With me in heart, carry on until the Kingdom is won.
With me in heart, remember love survives death into eternity.
I will constantly intercede, so let our tribe grow to plenty.

Remember the Bard who brings my message to you to stand.
Remember you said you both would cherish our children with your vision so grand.
Remember your beliefs and serve the forces with grit and sand.
Make sure your learning specialists never cook a dish too bland.

Rather feed our children's imagination that someday they'll cure,
Rather than fuss and fume and barter their souls forgetting the lore,
Rather show them that lore is what makes heroes - so to soar
Into timeless skies, where for the Future Earth they'll roar!
