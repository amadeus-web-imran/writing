## What is IDEAS

An acronym for an "Institute for the Development of Effective Applications of Spirituality", IDEAS is a virtual group of **pluralists, interfaith believers** and progressive religious leaders.

We believe strongly in a "spiritual democracy" and are saddeded by the amount of **friction and war** caused "in the name of" religion.

A couple of [quotes to set some context](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/topics/religion/):

* Religion is a great force — the only real motive force in the world; but what you fellows don't understand is that you must get at a man through his own religion and not through yours. - George Bernard Shaw
* So many gods, so many creeds — So many paths that wind and wind While just the art of being kind Is all the sad world needs.
* You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being. - Albert Einstein
* God uses Atheism as a stone to break the encrustations of religion - Sri Aurobindo.
* Such religion as there can be in modern life, every individual will have to salvage from the churches for himself.
* Human things must be known to be loved; but Divine things must be loved to be known. - Blaise Pascal

Do let us know your thoughts and we will be happy to begin a discussion with you.

* As a youth, do you feel uncomfortable with the beliefs of your parents? Are you seeking questions and will a deeper understanding of the metaphysics or spiritual laws of the universe help?
* Are you put off by dogma and superstition, and has your "scientific" study made you question how a Cosmic / Divine [can exist if science hasnt proved it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcqaHxI5-P8)?
