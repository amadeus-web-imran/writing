## Dare I BUILD - 15 Oct 2018

To THEE [Sri Aurobindo] who has been the Material Envelope of OUR MASTER. That Master who abides deep in our heart, who smile can light up and set at peace a despairing soul - whose very memory can make all the toils and struggles of yester-year seem worth the effort & wash away the seeming cost - whose countenance & temper make life again worth living.

To SHE (The Mother, Mirra Alfassa), that incarnate of the 4 Shaktis - who causes the buds and leaves of our heart to blossom and REKINDLE life in the seeming inertness of it's autumn.

---

Mostly zest, gaity and courage to FACE LIFE on equal footing, and to remember always that life is always about the moments we live - not SQUANDER on our pettinesses and inability to love completely.

Love completely with the whole of your soul. Love unto eternity and BEYOND - [Until Many many days of Brahma have passed and you realize the IMMORTALITY of every SOUL].

Love every last spec of creation for the divinity latent even in its seemingly inconscient movements!

Nearly 10 years since I rallied around the cry - BUILD!!

> Build What you may VERY WELL ASK?

A new Utopia? Why not? But How?

Lovingly, one brick, tile, pillar and beam at a time!

The many ventures we enjoin and causes we espouse.

> Dare I BUILD? The answer - from the deeps inside [The SEA Inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Inside)
>
> YES, 1 100 Million Billion times YES.

We are all [Builders](%url%for/msa/), [Smiths](https://smithy.amadeusweb.world/) and [Earthshakers](%url%keep-smiling/).
