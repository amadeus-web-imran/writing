> This is an appreciation for the [Philip Pullman novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tiger_in_the_Well), where the hero Dan Goldberg stops two conflicted factions (Christian and Jew) from fighting by telling them a story of how the Oligarchs (controlling few) have exploited them and set them to fight with each other with propaganda. I was quite young and impressionable when I read it first nearly 20 years ago. You can see the [chapter excerpt here](%url%prose/reviews/books/tiger/index.htmlBTNOUTLINEINFO~~TARGETNEW) or [download it](%url%prose/reviews/books/tiger/tiger-in-the-well--danny-tells-them-a-story--curated-2015.pdfBTNDOWNLOAD~~TARGETNEW) ~ Jul 2023

There was a contest between Fartbelly, the beguiler of the powers-that-be and [Dan Goldberg](https://www.google.com/search?q=daniel+goldberg+philip+pullman).

Both wove their magic with the sheer clarity and detail of the stories they told. Watching them contend reminds me of when Bhishma or Drona or Karna were fighting in that Dharmakshetre when the Gods themselves would come to watch.

One fought to destroy, divide and defile, pouring oil on dying embers. Daniel stood tall that day, at the [battle of telegraph road, pg 117](https://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10063/2613/thesis.pdf?sequence=2), saving 2 clans from damnation and destruction.

What a story he told! He told of fartbelly and how the enemy was always waiting to keep the plebians down in the mud. The enemy - the forces that be, whose utter destruction we all root for.

I don't remember who said it, but someone mighty wise said - give love a chance, give freedom a chance, give evolution a chance. Why? Because we are all here to love, evolve and enjoy freedom while doing that!

Destructuon, not of their physical bodies, but of the lower tendencies they have, the utter lust for power, the pettiness, the trysts with the devilish forces, the disregard for human life and everything decent and wholesome.

Daniel's story? That hit home hard. That we are akin to each other in our **[grit and determination](https://www.countryliving.com/life/g32347899/perseverance-bible-quotes/)** in the face of hardship. That only if we live in ignorance of the facts that every last person is pure at heart and [deserves warmth and love](https://www.soundvision.com/article/the-quran-and-hadith-on-mothers), are we less than we ought to be, found wanting in the maker's plan?

No, we only go through the ups and downs of life to sensitize our nature and to strengthen our character. Something about the fire of the potter's oven...

I may have digressed a little, but [Philip Pullman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Pullman)'s entire novel [Tiger in the Well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tiger_in_the_Well) is a credit to the writing profession and a rallying call for us to **awaken the [pacifist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism) inside**.

For one bloodshot, fatigued writer to climb up on a chair and defuse a clash and save a few lives and torn ears, I can only say - keep telling us a story Danny boy, keep telling us OUR story! - one that inspires and unites.
