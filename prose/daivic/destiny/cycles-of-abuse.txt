<h2>Witness</h2>
On Rape,
Beaten.
I saw you cry.
I saw you rape.

<h2>Victim</h2>
I stopped letting you **project** your evil on me.
I healed myself.
I absorbed the learning.
I healed the world.

<h2>Humanity</h2>
We rooted out every vestige of evil.
Life was explained.
We thanked the universe for the lesson.
We updated the rule book.

<h2>Judge</h2>
I looked at the monster.
I remembered the child he once was.
He wept, and
We washed away the defilement.

<h2>Executioner</h2>
Only love remained in me.
He looked in the mirror devastated.
I saw a shattered, shattered man.
He wept and sued for pardon.

<h2>Provost Marshal</h2>
He was given **5 minutes of heaven**.
We saw beyond the dualities of Yin an Yang.
He became the custodian of the inmost secrets,
Having conquered the shadow that had cloaked him.

<h2>Brahman</h2>
He bathed once more in the divine light of consciousness.
Unstooped his hunch.
And his harmonica sang again again clear and true.
His victim was dread to see him on the worlds stage again.

<h2>Victim</h2>
And hid her eyes to blot out the memory of the prolonged assault,
Her innocence lost, her heart dullened.
Until many decades later, she found her voice again.
Only to have it snatched away when he passed by on the street.

<h2>Provost Marshal</h2>
She said he was lying when he said he had indeed repent.
She asked that he be burnt at the stake.
The hatred flowing the wild mob howling at the smell of blood in the air.
Then a voice began to moan and cry, it said, O people of Orphalese, listen to me say:

<h2>Al Mustafa</h2>
Vengeance is Mine Sayeth the Lord,
So tie him to a tree and cut out his heart,
Then roast it on a spit and pepper it,
An offer it at the Altar upon Meneltarma.

<h2>Prot</h2>
So you would perpetuate violence?
And have an eye for an eye?
Known throughout the universe for it's stupidity .
Have you not forgotten Portia's plea about the Quality of Mercy?

<h2>Shasa</h2>
Remember well Rumi my friends who is waiting for us in the field,
And the real Al Mustafa, not this fraudster on the pulpit.
Not to mention The Lord's prayer where we beg to be forgiven our
Trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

<h2>Vyasa</h2>
Qayamath (Judgement Day) is for the Judge of Judges alone,
No Human Hand Should exceed It's authority,
For we must believe in love surviving death into eternity.

<h2>Brahman</h2>
I saw another writer named Goldberg sue for the monster's pardon,
But the crowd kept yelling, Off with his Head,
Then Shasa Ferret let go the Premasthra,
And Humanity all ascended at once, love cresting until it burst forth through the fontanelle.

A few strings and quarks vibrated, the new cosmos had begun with a bang!
The old one imploded, its suns went nova,
Creating black holes that spread dark matter throughout the cosmos,
The cycles of the Yugas began again.

<h2>Humanity</h2>
The world surged with passion and untrammeled joy,
Until, one day, autumn came and the sky turned dark for all the colour's had faded to black...
The monster came a knocking once more,
Into a little girl's bedroom, and we turned a blind eye, shorn of memory though for a brief moment, there was a the smell of burning flesh, stained trousers, blood, sweat and tears...
